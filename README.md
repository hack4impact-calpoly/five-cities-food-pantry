## Overview

### Purpose

At Five Cities Christian Women's Food Pantry, the organization addresses food insecurities within neighborhoods and take actions to supply these needs. With the help of volunteers, donations of food come from a variety of locations such as grocery stores, generous individuals and families, schools, and congregational groups which then allows distribution into neighborhoods and families. With the help of our project manager, tech lead, designers, and developers, we aim to create a website application that allows the nonprofit to track their clients weekly to then create a monthly report.
